        This group of musicians from Marseillan, boasts a broad repertoire
          from the good oldies to contemporary music. Let them take you to that
          “late night jazz club” feeling with their pleasant swing, bluesy and
          jazzy tunes! With their charm and sharp wit, vocalist Gabrielle (on
          double bass), and Christine on drums offer you their classics: each
          piece is a story told together with Jeff, their creative guitarist.
          <br />

          The original trio was recently joined by Thierry on keyboard and
          Stéphane on guitar. New horizons are opening up to create an
          unexpected musical universe with simplicity and humor to wow the
          audience with.

        The Scandinavian standard for hot swing!
        <br />
        Founded in Oslo in 1979 by Jon Larsen, the group has toured continuously
        in Norway and around the world for over 40 years. Larsen has released
        dozens of albums, with Django Reinhardt and his Quintette du Hot Club de
        France as his main inspiration.

        Spearheading the revival of gypsy jazz worldwide in the 80s, the group
        received numerous awards and collaborated with the biggest names in the
        genre, such as Stochelo Rosenberg, Biréli Lagrène, Angelo Debarre, Jimmy
        Rosenberg, Adrien Moignard or Florin Niculescu, as well as artists like
        Jon Gordon or Howard Alden. Other collaborations include string
        ensembles such as the Camelia Strykekvartett and the symphony orchestras
        of Kristiansand, Tromsø and Trondheim (Norway).

        <br />
        First a trio, the band has grown and gone through a few line-up changes
        over the years. Today it consists of founding member Svein Aarbostad
        (double bass), violinist/harmonicist Finn Hauge, French guitarist Gildas
        Le Pape and newcomer Ola Erlien. With members aged 22 to 72, the group
        brilliantly demonstrates that jazz defies all borders!
